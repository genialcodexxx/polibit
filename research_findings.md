## Detailed React-Flask Architecture Analysis

### Complete System Architecture Components

Based on the comprehensive analysis of a production React-Flask application, here are the detailed technical components:

#### 1. Frontend Layer (React)
- **Framework**: React with PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Different UI for desktop/laptop vs mobile devices
- **API Communication**: REST API endpoints for all backend communication
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with local storage
- **Mobile Support**: PWA installation on Android devices
- **CORS**: Configured to accept requests only from authorized frontend

#### 2. Backend Layer (Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask REST API
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for all operations
- **Authentication**: Custom authentication mechanism with session verification
- **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations through Flask API
- **Search Integration**: Elasticsearch integration for search functionality
- **CORS Configuration**: Enabled to accept requests from React frontend
- **Error Handling**: 401 errors for authentication failures

#### 3. Data Layer Architecture
**Primary Database (PostgreSQL)**:
- Stores all application data (recipes, users, etc.)
- Handles all CRUD operations
- Connected via Flask API

**Session Management (Redis)**:
- Stores user session data and tokens
- Enables persistent sessions across app reopens
- Session verification for each API call
- Fast access for authentication checks

**Search Engine (Elasticsearch)**:
- Dedicated search index for recipes
- Stores recipe names and user associations
- Returns recipe IDs for detailed data fetching
- Integrated with Flask API for search operations

**Backup Strategy**:
- Backup PostgreSQL database
- Data replication every 5-6 hours
- DNS switching capability for failover
- High availability architecture

#### 4. File Storage & CDN
**File Service (Node.js/Express)**:
- Separate microservice for file operations
- Endpoints for upload, delete, and file management
- Google Drive storage integration
- Handles images, documents, and other file types

**Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
- Serves static files faster to users
- Improves download speeds and user experience
- Integrated with Google Drive storage
- Global content distribution

#### 5. Authentication Flow
**Session-Based Authentication Process**:
1. User performs action (e.g., clicks recipe)
2. Frontend calls backend API with locally stored session data
3. Flask API verifies session data against Redis database
4. If verified, request proceeds; if not, 401 error returned
5. Password stored in hashed form in PostgreSQL
6. Session persistence across app reopens

#### 6. Deployment Architecture
**Containerization**:
- All components deployed in Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration for production
- Microservices architecture pattern

**Free Tier Deployment Options**:
- Heroku for backend services
- Free database services for development

## Payment Integration Research

### Stripe Integration with Flask
Based on the TestDriven.io tutorial analysis:

#### Stripe Payment Strategies:
1. **Charges API** (Legacy): Not recommended for new implementations due to lack of SCA support
2. **Stripe Checkout** (Recommended): Fast setup, manages entire payment process, supports multiple languages and recurring payments
3. **Payment Intents API** (Advanced): For customized payment experiences with Stripe Elements

#### Implementation Components:
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Stripe Secret Key
   - Stripe Publishable Key
   - Webhook Endpoint Secret

2. **Core Flask Routes**:
   - Product display page
   - Checkout session creation
   - Success/cancel redirect handling
   - Webhook endpoint for payment confirmation

3. **Stripe Checkout Flow**:
   ```python
   # Create checkout session
   checkout_session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
       payment_method_types=['card'],
       line_items=[{
           'price_data': {
               'currency': 'usd',
               'product_data': {'name': product_name},
               'unit_amount': price_in_cents,
           },
           'quantity': 1,
       }],
       mode='payment',
       success_url=success_url,
       cancel_url=cancel_url,
   )
   ```

4. **Webhook Handling**:
   - Verify webhook signatures
   - Handle `checkout.session.completed` events
   - Process successful payments
   - Update order status and trigger digital delivery

#### Security Considerations:
- Environment variable management for API keys
- Webhook signature verification
- HTTPS requirement for production
- PCI compliance through Stripe
